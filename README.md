# Spirit Stones
A small React app that simulates a shop of custom cooling stones for drinks, with recommendations, mood-based selection and a playful ordering flow.\
**Live demo**: https://ekvisa.github.io/SpiritStones/

## Concept
The idea came from noticing that most whiskey stones look the same. What if cooling stones could have different characters and fit different drinks?\
The app focuses on choice, mood and exploration rather than strict rules: recommendations are optional, and the user can freely combine stones.

## Features
- Step-by-step selection flow (drink → stone class → stone → quantity)
- Optional drink-based recommendations
- Random selection when a specific stone is not chosen
- Cart with multiple sets
- Order modal with a random phrase and visual emoji representation

## Tech stack
- React
- TypeScript
- Functional components & hooks
- Controlled forms
- Lifting state up & props-based data flow
